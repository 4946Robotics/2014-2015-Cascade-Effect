To do
=====

[IN PROGRESS] Cooperation
	[COMPLETED] Email all programmers
	[COMPLETED] Add all programmers to organization
	[IN PROGRESS] Ensure that all of next years programmers can do everything
		[COMPLETED] Have them set up the field control system (hardware and software)
		[NOT STARTED] After the competition, make sure they can write a basic working teleop
	[COMPLETED] Show programmers TODO.txt, make sure they know to update it after every session next year
	[COMPLETED] Force Robert to finish the Bluetooth Instructions.txt
	[NOT STARTED] Talk to rest of team about having a place for all pictures and videos of robot

[COMPLETED] Fix/Decrease lag
	[COMPLETED] Test lag in program
	[COMPLETED] Obtain router

[ABORTED] Research math behind Vector drive
	[ABORTED] Translation
	[ABORTED] Rotation

[IN PROGRESS] Notes
	[COMPLETED] Add method for creating the ad hoc network to notes

[WORKING] Omni drive
	[COMPLETED] Translation
	[COMPLETED] Rotation
	[COMPLETED] Program it
	[COMPLETED] Make the code somewhat understandable
	[COMPLETED] Implement code that uses trigonometry to calculate wheel speeds
	[NOT STARTED] Look at values printing on NXT to determine if scaling or trimming of TrigDrive is needed
	[COMPLETED] Add other code to TrigDriv branch so it can be used normally
	[NOT STARTED] Compare drive-ablity of two teleop controls
	[COMPLETED] Merge / abandon TrigDrive branch

[CAN PLACE BLOCKS] Autonomous
	[COMPLETED] Reverse left/right direction if distance sensor reads a big jump (prevent driving off forever)
	[IN PROGRESS] Branch off and add code to make robot drive onto ramp after placing block
	[COMPLETED] Merge the zoom in autonomous into the main branch
	[COMPLETED] Reduce delays in block placing code (squeeze out more time for driving onto ramp)

[COMPLETED] Scrimmage
	[COMPLETED] Make sure that the robot is running the omni1 teleop code until trig drive is complete
	[COMPLETED] Add non-driving functions to TrigDrive and upload to robot
	[COMPLETED] Ask about the flag raiser (motor has been mounted)

[NOT STARTED] Competition
	[COMPLETED] Make sure robot is using latest teleop code
	[NOT STARTED] Make sure robot is using latest autonomous code
	[NOT STARTED] Gather stats on other robots (check the form)
